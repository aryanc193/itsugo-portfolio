# Commentto — Case Study

> A production-ready Chrome extension build + web app that summarizes long-form content and generates concise, thoughtful comments in the user’s writing voice.  
> Designed for real-world usage, not prompt demos.

---

## Background / Why This Matters

Engaging with long-form content (blogs, LinkedIn posts, essays) has a hidden cost:

- reading takes time
- writing thoughtful comments takes even more time
- most AI tools produce generic, off-voice responses

I wanted to explore what happens when:

- **AI understands the content first**
- **responses are conditioned on a strict “voice profile”**
- **the tool lives directly in the browser**
- **there is no account system or friction**

The goal was to reduce the _activation energy_ of thoughtful engagement.

---

## Project Goal

Build a system that:

- extracts meaningful content from any webpage
- summarizes it accurately
- generates a short comment in a specific writing voice
- works instantly from the browser
- feels lightweight and disposable, not like a SaaS app

---

## My Role

I built the entire system end-to-end:

- Chrome extension (MV3 + Vite)
- React popup UI
- Background + content script communication
- AI backend (Next.js API routes)
- Voice modeling and prompt design
- Monorepo architecture and deployment

## Architecture Overview

### **Monorepo Structure**

```txt
commentto/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Next.js app + API routes
│   └── extension/    # Chrome extension (Vite + MV3)
│
├── packages/
│   ├── types/        # Shared domain contracts
│   ├── voices/       # Preset voice definitions
│   ├── utils/        # Shared helpers
│   └── ui/           # Reusable UI components
```

This structure ensured:

- a single source of truth for voices and types
- no duplication across web and extension
- predictable imports via workspace packages
- easy future expansion (API, mobile, paid tiers)

---

## How It Works (Flow)

1. User clicks **Generate** in the extension popup.
2. Background service worker injects a content script.
3. Page text is extracted from `article`, `main`, or `body`.
4. Content is sent to the production API.
5. Backend:

   - safely truncates input
   - summarizes content
   - generates a voice-conditioned comment

6. Result is returned to the popup UI.
7. The extension is currently loaded via developer mode, allowing rapid iteration without store-level constraints.

The entire flow is designed to feel instant and local.

---

## AI & Voice Modeling

### **Summarization**

- Low temperature for stability
- Opinion-free summaries
- Explicit truncation guard for long pages

### **Voice Profiles**

Instead of vague prompts like _“be casual”_, each voice is defined as a **concrete profile** describing:

- tone
- sentence structure
- behavioral rules

This significantly reduced “voice drift” and made generations consistent across runs.

---

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### **1. Chrome Extension MV3 + ESM**

**Problem:**
Service workers failed silently due to ESM vs classic script mismatch.

**Solution:**

- Explicitly marked the background worker as a module
- Flattened build output for Chrome compatibility

**Why it mattered:**
Modern bundlers default to ESM, but MV3 requires precise configuration.

---

### **2. Monorepo Dependency Drift**

**Problem:**
Types and voice presets began drifting between web and extension.

**Solution:**

- Migrated to a pnpm workspace
- Extracted shared logic into packages
- Enforced lockfile correctness in CI

**Why it mattered:**
Prevented subtle runtime mismatches and simplified iteration.

---

### **3. Voice Consistency (“AI Voice Drift”)**

**Problem:**
Early generations felt similar across different voices.

**Solution:**

- Tightened prompt constraints
- Made presets opinionated and explicit
- Reduced model freedom where consistency mattered

---

## Browser Extension Design Philosophy

I intentionally avoided:

- user accounts
- cloud persistence
- onboarding flows
- paid gates

Instead, the extension is:

- instant
- local-first
- private by default
- usable without commitment

Custom voices are stored using browser storage and persist across sessions.

---

## Outcomes / Learnings

This project reinforced several lessons:

- browser extensions surface real-world edge cases quickly
- explicit prompt constraints matter more than clever wording
- monorepos reduce complexity _when used intentionally_
- product friction is often architectural, not UX-only
- shipping across multiple surfaces changes how you design APIs

---

# Final Thoughts

Commentto was not built as a tutorial clone or demo.

It reflects:

- real architectural trade-offs
- production debugging
- product-driven design decisions
- thinking beyond a single UI surface

It’s the kind of system I’d want to use daily — and the kind I enjoy building.

The system is fully deployable today, with Chrome Web Store publication intentionally deferred until product direction is validated.
