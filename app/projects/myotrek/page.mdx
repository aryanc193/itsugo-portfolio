# Myotrek — Case Study

> A full React Native fitness tracker with personalized workout logging, stats, and smooth navigation.  
> Built as a freelance project and deployed on both the Play Store and App Store.

## Background / Why This Matters

This project came from a client who built a compact home-gym device that uses magnetic resistance to replicate gym-style training.  
They needed a mobile app that could:

- guide users through workouts
- show proper form through embedded tutorial videos
- log sets, reps, and volume
- sync progress across devices

It was a practical problem:  
**a physical product needed a digital companion** to make the experience complete.

---

## Project Goal

Build a mobile app that:

- works smoothly on both Android and iOS
- lets users log workouts and track stats
- embeds YouTube tutorials for each exercise
- stores data efficiently without recurring database costs
- ships on time despite tight tooling and device constraints

Since this was a freelance delivery, the app had to feel polished, intuitive, and reliable.

---

## My Role

I handled all frontend engineering:

- React Native (Expo SDK 52)
- Workout screens, logging UI, and stats
- Navigation, layout, and transitions
- Embedded video flows
- Local data structures for workouts
- Coordination with backend (Firebase)

A teammate managed Firebase auth, Firestore, and deployments.

## Architecture Overview

### **Frontend**

- React Native + Expo 52
- Custom workout screens with set/rep/volume tracking
- Local library file storing exercises, names, images, and tutorial links
- Robust navigation setup for multi-screen flow
- Visual stats and progress summaries

### **Backend**

- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore for cloud sync
- Expo EAS for builds and updates

### **Content Storage**

To avoid recurring database costs, we shipped a **local exercise library** inside the app bundle:

- metadata
- images
- tutorial URLs
- categories

It kept the product lightweight and inexpensive to maintain.

---

## How It Works (Flow)

1. User opens the app and logs in.
2. Chooses a workout category or exercise.
3. Tutorial video loads through a YouTube embed.
4. User logs sets, reps, volume, or duration.
5. Data syncs to Firebase (or is saved locally when offline).
6. Stats and charts update automatically.
7. Monthly leaderboards show top performers across metrics.

The flow stays consistent across iOS and Android.

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### **1. Tooling and Version Mismatches**

**Problem:**  
Expo, React Native, EAS, Play Store, and App Store tooling all demanded different versions and configs.  
Builds would fail for reasons that weren’t obvious.

**Solution:**  
We rebuilt the environment using the latest Expo SDK, re-aligned packages, and followed documentation strictly.  
Keeping everything on the most recent toolchain turned out to be the most stable approach.

---

### **2. Limited Development Hardware**

**Problem:**  
My personal laptop struggled during builds, and we had no macOS device initially for iOS deployment.

**Solution:**  
We optimized dev builds with lighter configs and eventually secured a MacBook towards the end of the project specifically for App Store deployment.  
That made our final shipping window possible.

---

### **3. No Budget for Full Exercise Database**

**Problem:**  
The client didn’t want recurring costs for storing exercise metadata.

**Solution:**  
We embedded a local JSON-style library containing all workout definitions, images, and links.  
This kept the app lightweight, predictable, and free to maintain.

---

## Outcomes / Learnings

The app has been live for more than six months, with consistent usage and no production-breaking issues.  
Delivering on both stores taught me:

- store deployments require strict version discipline
- Expo + EAS can handle full production pipelines
- local libraries are a solid solution for early-stage products
- cross-platform video embedding needs careful testing
- reliable UX is more about predictability than complexity

This project was a strong, real-world exercise in end-to-end mobile delivery.

# Final Thoughts

Myotrek showed me what a complete mobile product cycle looks like: planning, building, aligning tools, shipping, and maintaining.  
It wasn’t the largest project, but it demanded discipline with versions, builds, and cross-platform consistency — exactly the challenges that make mobile work interesting.
