# Book Notes — Case Study

> A full-stack reading tracker built with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and EJS.  
> My own private space on the internet to store book notes, ratings, and reading history — complete with automatic book-cover fetching.

## Background / Why This Exists

I’ve always wanted a dedicated corner of the internet where I can manage my own reading progress — not Goodreads, not some SaaS app, but something built entirely for _me_.

I wanted:

- a fast way to log finished books
- a place to write my notes
- a rating system
- a clean UI
- and something that feels “mine”

That turned into **Book Notes**, a small but full-stack app with real authentication, database-backed CRUD operations, and a surprisingly fun retro-gold UI theme.

---

## Project Goal

The goal for this project was to build a personal tool that would let me:

- Add, edit, and delete books
- Store title, author, rating, finished date, and notes
- Auto-fetch cover images using **Open Library API**
- Sort books by title, rating, or date
- Protect actions behind a login
- Keep everything inside a smooth, responsive UI

It’s a simple idea, but it touches almost every core skill required in real backend development.

---

## My Role

This project is fully built by me — design, backend, frontend, database, deployment.  
My responsibilities included:

- Designing the PostgreSQL schema
- Writing all database queries
- Setting up Express routing
- Creating the custom middleware for authentication
- Integrating Open Library API
- Building the UI in EJS
- Implementing sorting + filtering
- Making the theme responsive
- Handling sessions and protected routes

It’s a solo-build, end-to-end.

## Architecture Overview

### **Stack**

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **View Engine:** EJS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API:** Open Library API for cover images
- **Auth:** express-session
- **Styling:** Custom CSS (retro-gold theme)
- **Other:** method-override, dotenv

### **Design Philosophy**

The app uses traditional server-side rendering instead of React.  
Every page is:

- fast
- lightweight
- SEO-friendly
- instantly loads with no hydration overhead

It follows the clean MVC pattern:

```
models/ → database queries
services/ → external APIs
views/ → EJS templates
routes → express logic
index.js → main server
```

---

## How It Works (Flow)

1. User logs in using a simple session-based form.
2. Once authenticated, they can access the dashboard.
3. Adding a book triggers:
   - validation
   - optional cover lookup from Open Library
   - insert into PostgreSQL
4. Editing or deleting uses PATCH/DELETE via method-override.
5. Sorting is done directly at the database level.
6. EJS templates render the UI with updated results.

A small example of auto-cover fetching:

```
const fetchCover = async (title) => {
  const url = `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title=${title}`;
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.json();

  return data?.docs?.[0]?.cover_i
    ? `https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/${data.docs[0].cover_i}-L.jpg`
    : null;
};
```

This makes adding new books surprisingly effortless.

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### **1. Handling cover-image fallback logic**

Sometimes the Open Library API returned no results, missing indexes, or incorrect cover IDs.

**Solution:**  
Added graceful fallbacks — either use the provided URL or default to a placeholder.  
The UI never breaks.

---

### **2. Designing an expressive database model**

Books needed:

- title
- author
- rating
- finished date
- notes (text)
- cover (URL)
- timestamps

**Solution:**  
Created a clean PostgreSQL schema and abstracted database logic into a separate `/models` folder.

---

### **3. Authentication without any frameworks**

I didn’t want Passport.js or heavy OAuth — just a lightweight personal login.

**Solution:**  
Using `express-session` with a simple credential check stored in `.env` kept things fast, minimal, and perfect for a private dashboard.

---

### **4. Making retro-gold UI look premium**

A retro-golden theme can look messy if done wrong.  
It needed to feel subtle, modern, and cozy.

**Solution:**

- layered gradients
- gold-accent hover transitions
- pixel-inspired layout
- soft shadows
- animated burger menu for small screens

This gave the app a warm identity instead of looking like boilerplate CSS.

---

## Outcomes / Learnings

Book Notes ended up becoming one of my most practical personal tools.

What I learned:

- building a complete MVC architecture
- structuring reusable server-side EJS components
- integrating external APIs smoothly
- designing session-based authentication
- managing database schemas for CRUD apps
- mobile-first UI thinking
- clean routing and controller logic

It’s a small project on the surface, but it taught me a lot about foundational backend engineering.

---

## Final Thoughts

Book Notes wasn’t made for show, it was made for _use_.  
It helped me understand real backend patterns, sharpen my database thinking, and build something I genuinely enjoy opening every day.

It’s not a flashy “API toy”, it’s a full-stack personal tool, and one of my most meaningful builds.
